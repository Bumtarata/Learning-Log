Learning Log is third of the final three projects from book
Python Crash Course 2ed and as it is a learning project, large parts of
the code were taken from there.

Learning Log is web application which users can use to make journal entries
about what they've learned about topics they are interested in. For running it
you need to open command line and from root directory run command: 

py manage.py runserver

then you can access the site by typing localhost:8000 to your web browser.
